## Overview 

Releases will initially be defined in the contract documents for the implementation. The Release schedule will be reviewed and confirmed or modified as part of the Project Kickoff Meetings. Once the Release schedule is confirmed, Release Cards should be setup in Trello along with the Features related to those Releases. 

Release Cards in Trello are used to collect all Features related to that Release in one place. From the Release card you will also be able to drill down to linked Features, as well as the Related Tasks, Decisions Made, Related Meetings, and Testing cards that have been linked to each Feature.![image](https://github.com/thamera/implement/assets/104372724/d6a458e8-03d4-4901-89e4-54d6935eee8c)
